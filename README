This code-base is to support all of the non-digitizer-based midas
frontends and other tools needed for DANCE.  It is presumed that this
will live inside of the midas expertiment directory in a directory like
'dance_custom'.  If set up in that way, then the links will work.
Otherwise, well, not so much.
